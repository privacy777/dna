A python library that allow users to build simple checkers. Allowing beginners and other users to make simple & efficient checkers in less than a 100 lines ! (100 lines included docstrings and spaces for easy code reading)

Because it handles all the boring things like opening combo & proxy files, init the checker name etc... to mainly focus on the main code.

This allow users to not get overwhelmed by "junk" code and mainly focus on their request section, allowing them to gain time and productivity.

Keep in mind that i'm the sole (at the moment) programmer on this project, i'm planning on constantly updating the library until i'm satisfied. Feel free to commit changes to the code and submit them. This code is collaborative !



## Features

- Simplicity
- Lightweight library (small code)
- Automated Queue
- Checker's setup (ASCII Title, Menu)
- Combo & Proxy-list loading
- Makes main code easier to read and smaller.
- Syncs and safe threads implementation making them easy to use
- Fully documented code with examples.


## Installation

Until release with pip, download the source code, put it in your checker's main code folder.

Please consider that this project is only maintained in python 3.6+ If you get any issue with python, consider downloading the latest version.


Then, using terminal
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
you can then import it in your main code
```bash
  from dna.setup import *
  from dna.threadingz import *
  from dna.proxies import *
```

## ðŸš€ About Me & this project
- Mainly programming in python, i'm also learning new languages.
- Made this for total beginners who still wanna learn how to code checkers.
- You can also check my guide (with images and in depth explanations to code a fully working checker in no time)
- You can always open issues if needed, or pull requests and suggest modifications.
