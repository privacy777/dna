A python library that allow users to build simple checkers. Allowing beginners and other users to make simple & efficient checkers in less than a 100 lines !
Because it handles all the boring things like opening combo & proxy files, init the checker name etc... to mainly focus on the main code.

This allow users to not get overwhelmed by "junk" code and mainly focus on their request section, allowing them to gain time and productivity.

Keep in mind that i'm the sole (at the moment) programmer on this project, i'm planning on constantly updating the library until i'm satisfied. Feel free to commit changes to the code and submit them. This code is collaborative !




## Features

- Simplicity
- Lightweight library (small code)
- Automated Queue
- Checker's setup (Title, Menu)
- Combo & Proxy-list loading

## Installation

Until release with pip, download the source code, put it in your checker's main code folder.

Please consider that this project is only maintained in python 3.6+ If you get any issue with python, consider downloading the latest version.


Then, using terminal
```bash
